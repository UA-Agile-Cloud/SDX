These two apps are RequestReceiving and RequestSending, which are integrated in ONOS.
1. the RequestSending app reads the request from a TXT document, and does some analysis and identification for the request
   and then sends the request to correct local RYU controllers.
2. the RequestReceiving receives the respond from Ryu to get the notification about the link setup.
